						<h2>What Is Black Ops 3 ?</h2>

					<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. It is the twelfth entry in the Call of Duty series and the sequel to the 2012 video game Call of Duty: Black Ops II. It was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 6, 2015.

						<h2>Gameplay</h2>
					</header>
					<p><strong>Campaign</strong><br />
The campaign in Black Ops III is designed to support 4-player cooperative gameplay, allowing for bigger, more open level design and less corridor shooting. In addition, the player can customize their character's sexual appearance and clothing. The campaign features its own progression system, featuring unlock tokens which must be used to acquire different weapons and gears as they progress through the campaign.[2] The game features a "realistic" difficulty mode, in which players will get defeated if they are hit by one bullet.[3] Finishing all campaign missions will also unlock "Nightmares" mode, where players can replay the entire campaign with a new narrative, as well as zombies replacing most of the normal enemies.
<br />
<strong>Multiplayer</strong><br />
The multiplayer introduces a new momentum-based movement system, which utilizes thruster packs to allow players to perform slow boosts into the air, as well as perform wall running and sliding, all the while giving players complete gun control.[4] In addition to the Pick 10 class system from Black Ops II, Treyarch implemented a character system called "Specialists", where players can pick from 9 different soldiers, each with either a special weapon or ability unique to them. A new specialist has also been released in the game. The specialist is blackjack who has the ability to mimic another specialists ability in battle. Black jack can only be unlocked for a certain period of time through specific challenges.[5] A new "Gunsmith" feature offers aesthetic variations in weapon attachments, allowing various weapon customization combinations.[6] The Paintshop feature allows players to create their own custom prints onto specific portions of a gun, further emphasizing the depth of customization in the game.</p>
